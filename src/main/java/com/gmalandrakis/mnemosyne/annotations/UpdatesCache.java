     * The names of the keys annotated as @UpdateKey that are to be used as keys for the particular cache to be updated.
     * The same method may update multiple caches at the same time, but some of the updateKeys may not be of interest for all
     * caches, hence the need for this array.
     * <p>
     * <b>Important: </b> the order of the keys has to be accurate. If you only use keys annotated as @UpdateKeys to update a cache,
     * you must give their names in the same order they are used as arguments in the underlying method.
     * And if you use a combination of annotatedKeys and targetObjectKeys, you must specify the ordering in the keyOrder (see below).
     * <p>
     * Not doing so may not lead to exceptions or even warnings, and may only lead to "silent" errors in what the caches return.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     *
     * @Cached(name="getTransactionsByUser")
     * public List<Transaction> getTransactionsByUser(String userId, boolean pending);
     *
     * @Cached(name="getTransactionByUUID")
     * public Transaction unrelatedCache(UUID uuid);
     *
     * @UpdatesCache(name="getTransactionByUUID", annotatedKeys={"uuid"})
     * @UpdatesCache(name="getTransactionsByUser", annotatedKeys={"userId", "pending"}) //Could lead to a class-cast exception if it was {"pending", "userId"}, and would lead to silent cache discrepancies if both were Strings in the method!
     * public Transaction createTransactionForUser(@UpdateKey(name="userId") String userId, @UpdateKey(name="pending") boolean pending, @UpdateKey UUID uuid)
